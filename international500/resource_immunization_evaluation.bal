# FHIR ImmunizationEvaluation resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + date - The date the evaluation of the vaccine administration event was performed.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this immunization evaluation record.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + doseStatus - Indicates if the dose is valid or not valid with respect to the published recommendations.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + description - Additional information about the evaluation.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + immunizationEvent - The vaccine administration event being evaluated.
# + doseNumber - Nominal position in a series as determined by the outcome of the evaluation process.
# + seriesDoses - The recommended number of doses to achieve immunity as determined by the outcome of the evaluation process.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + doseStatusReason - Provides an explanation as to why the vaccine administration event is valid or not relative to the published recommendations.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + patient - The individual for whom the evaluation is being done.
# + series - One possible path to achieve presumed immunity against a disease - within the context of an authority.
# + authority - Indicates the authority who published the protocol (e.g. ACIP).
# + targetDisease - The vaccine preventable disease the dose is being evaluated against.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + status - Indicates the current status of the evaluation of the vaccination administration event.
