# FHIR VerificationResult resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + statusDate - When the validation status was updated.
# + nextScheduled - The date when target is next validated, if appropriate.
# + primarySource - Information about the primary source(s) involved in validation.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + attestation - Information about the entity attesting to information.
# + failureAction - The result if validation fails (fatal; warning; record only; none).
# + need - The frequency with which the target must be validated (none; initial; periodic).
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + validationType - What the target is validated against (nothing; primary source; multiple sources).
# + validator - Information about the entity validating information.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + targetLocation - The fhirpath location(s) within the resource that was validated.
# + frequency - Frequency of revalidation.
# + target - A resource that was validated.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + lastPerformed - The date/time validation was last completed (including failed validations).
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + validationProcess - The primary process by which the target is validated (edit check; value set; primary source; multiple sources; standalone; in context).
# + status - The validation status of the target (attested; validated; in process; requires revalidation; validation failed; revalidation failed).
